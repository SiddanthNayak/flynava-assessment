# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## React - Wookie Movies

### Description

You are the owner of a movie theater in **Thikkiiana City,** on the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk. Your customers are bored with the never changing selection and are asking for something completely different - they want to see what's playing on Earth. Create a Web App for them.

### Tasks

- Implement your design using **React Components** and style them using **CSS3**
- Create an login page and movies listing page as well as movie details page
- Implement a mock authorization function which returns default token (`Wookie2019`)
- Create protected route
- Implement session management
- Connect your application to the **Movie Database** at https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies
- For authentication pass the default token as "Authorization: Bearer Wookie2019" in header ideally through  
  an interceptor
- Parse the API response and display the results as outlined in the design. **Group movies by genres**.
- You may use any Packages or UI frameworks of your choice.
- You may use any state management library of your choice, if needed.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Design all three pages according to attached files using React Components
- Use of SCSS in place of CSS (no inline style as well as try creating components
  with as much props as you need)
- Connect to API - Movies retrieved, JSON parsed, grouped by genres
- Write test cases with your choice of framework

#### Bonus

- ES6 standards
- Lint free code
- Proper folder structures
- Use of creative design to showcase movies list
- Code coverage more than 95%
